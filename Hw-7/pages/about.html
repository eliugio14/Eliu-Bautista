    <p id="about-content">OSCB was started in the heart of South L.A. Our goal was to create and grow with a group of South L.A boxers. In about a year in the promotion business we were approached by many boxers outside of L.A. We had to decline them because it was not in our vision to recruit outside boxers. After that year we shifted our vision statement and we all agreed that we were going to welcome boxers from all placess. We are happy with our decision. At this moment we are promoting 15 fighter. and we have over 20 sponsors and partners working along with us. Last year we launched our oficial clothing line with the help of one of our partners Redefine LA. We are working together to provide exciting content and apparel </p>
